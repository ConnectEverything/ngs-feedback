# NGS Feedback

The purpose of this repository is for discussion around Synadia's
[NGS](https://synadia.com/ngs), including issues, questions, comments, and
feature requests for users and customers of NGS. We will provide answers
to questions and resolve problems to the best of our effort.

## Questions, Feature requests, and Issues

For general questions don't forget to first check out our
[NGS FAQ](https://docs.synadia.com/other-resources/faq).

If you do have a commercial support plan with Synadia, open a ticket at
[Synadia Support](https://support.synadia.com/) to ensure we prioritize
your request. To learn about support options contact us at
[info@synadia.com](mailto:info@synadia.com?subject=Commercial%20Support). 

Otherwise, if there is a feature you would like to see or if you are encountering a
problem, certainly feel free to open an
[issue](https://github.com/ConnectEverything/ngs-feedback/issues/new/choose) and we
will respond as soon as we can.

## Email

Alternatively, email us at info@synadia.com with any questions, issues, requests or comments. 
No issue or request is too big or too small.

## Developer Resources

Applications connecting to NGS use the Open Source NATS.io SDKs. Clients maintained by the
NATS Authors should work with NGS. Other clients may work although there are no guarantees.

More information can be found here:

- [NGS FAQ](https://docs.synadia.com/other-resources/faq)
- [NATS Documentation](https://docs.nats.io)
- [NATS Slack](https://slack.nats.io)
- [The NATS CLI Tool](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/clients#installing-the-nats-cli-tool)
- [NATS Clients](https://nats.io/download/#clients)

Example code can be found in each of the NATS client repositories;
simply use `connect.ngs.global` as the connect URL and provide your NGS
credentials to connect.
